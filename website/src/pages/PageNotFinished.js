            <h2>Infant, Child Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)</h2>
            <p>
                The order of CPR for infants and children (0-8 years old) is as follows. However, it is classified according to the physique, and even an 8-year-old child has a large physique, it is performed in the same way as adult CPR. <br/><br/>
                1. Report to an emergency medical institution. <br/>
                2. Confirm the consciousness of the patient. <br/>
                3. Use an automatic defibrillator (AED) immediately if available, but not if there is no child electrode. <br/>
                4. Conduct number 7. If you are not nearby, apply chest compressions immediately. If cardiopulmonary resuscitation is not trained, continue chest compression until a defibrillator is brought. If you are educated, keep your airway by tilting the subject's head back after 30 chest compressions. However, infants do not tilt their heads. <br/>
                5. Cover the subject's nose and perform artificial breathing twice through the mouth. In the case of infants, the operator's mouth is used to cover both the patient's nose and mouth with the operator's mouth to breathe in. <br/>
                6. Continue number 4 and 5 until the defibrillator is brought in. <br/>
                7. After using a defibrillator, immediately perform 4, 5, and 6. The defibrillator is operated continuously every two minutes.
